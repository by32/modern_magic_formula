# Security Remediation - modern_magic_formula

## Issue Fixed
- **Date**: July 30, 2025
- **Issue**: Build artifacts containing encryption keys in version control
- **Severity**: LOW (Build Artifacts)

## Findings Analysis

### Next.js Build Artifacts - RESOLVED ✅
- **Files**: `web/.next/server/server-reference-manifest.json` and others
- **Detection**: Next.js encryption keys in build cache
- **Analysis**: These are build-time generated keys for Next.js server components, not production secrets
- **Risk**: Low - these are temporary build artifacts, not user data encryption keys

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Created root-level `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns
2. ✅ Removed `web/.next/` build directory entirely
3. ✅ Added patterns to prevent future build artifact commits:
   - `web/.next/`
   - `web/out/`
   - `web/node_modules/`

## Analysis
The detected "API keys" were Next.js build artifacts:
- Server-side rendering encryption keys (temporary)
- Build cache files that should never be committed
- No actual production secrets or user data at risk

## Prevention
- Root `.gitignore` now prevents all build artifacts
- Web-specific `.gitignore` already existed but artifacts were committed before it
- Future builds will not commit these files

## Recommendation
Run `npm run build` in `web/` directory to regenerate clean build artifacts locally. The new build will generate fresh temporary keys that won't be committed.
